NUKE is a JavaFX chatbot task manager with a glitchy UI, a robot voice, and absolutely zero chill. Built as a school assignment. Powered by spite.

## 📸 Features

### ✅ Task Management
Add, delete, mark, unmark, and find tasks — all through a chat interface because typing into a box is more fun than clicking buttons.

Supports three task types:

| Type | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ToDo` | `add ToDo <description>` | `add ToDo touch grass` |
| `Deadline` | `add Deadline <date> <description>` | `add Deadline 2026-12-31 finish assignment` |
| `Event` | `add Event <start> <end> <description>` | `add Event 2026-01-01 2026-01-02 new years` |

### 💾 Save / Load Persistence
Your tasks are automatically saved to disk and reloaded on startup. NUKE remembers everything. Even the embarrassing tasks.

### 🖥️ Glitchy JavaFX GUI
The UI randomly:
- Shifts the background image around the screen
- Flickers the green tint
- Adjusts contrast and saturation

This is a feature, not a bug.

### 🤖 Robot Voice TTS
NUKE reads all responses aloud using your OS's built-in text-to-speech engine. Because reading is for humans.

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Tests cover command processing, task creation, and save/load behaviour. They do not cover the glitch effects because chaos cannot be unit tested.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

NUKE reads from `config/config.txt` on startup to locate the commands and save files. If you move things around and it breaks, that's on you.

---

## 🪦 Known Issues

- The glitch effect is permanent and cannot be turned off
- The robot voice will read your most embarrassing tasks aloud
- `Microsoft Sam` is not available on all Windows installs and NUKE is upset about it
